    <h3>Description</h3>
    The finest ingredients are brought together with love and care, then slow cooked to perfection. Yes, the old ways are still best 
    at Los Pollos Hermanos. But don't take my word for it. One taste, and you'll know.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1x chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>600ml buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground sage</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine buttermilk with salt and pepper in large glass or plastic container.
             Add chicken, mix thoroughly, cover and leave overnight.</li>
        <li>Combine flour with salt, pepper, cayenne, sage, paprika, coriander and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs with hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Drain chicken until mostly dry. Put flour mix into large freezer bag then,
             two or three pieces at a time, add chicken and shake until thoroughly coated.</li>
        <li>Put dusted chicken aside until all are done. Do not discard flour mix.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece of chicken through egg mixture until coated, then place back into flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Coat each piece in the same way, then leave to sit for 15 minutes to allow crust to stick to chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in deep fryer or saucepan until 175c. Cook chicken, three pieces at a time, for 12-15 minutes, 
            or until golden. Juices should come out clear when knife is inserted to the bone.</li>
        <li>Serve with fries or biscuits and gravy.</li>
    </ol>
